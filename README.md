# React Native Style Tachyons

WIP


Basically a fork of [tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons) but using the standard names, more selectors and better representation of grays (`gray1`, `gray2`, etc is much easier to type and remember than Tachyons' `moon-gray` etc)
