# React Native Tachyons Standard

WIP


Basically a fork of [tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons) but using the standard names, more selectors and better representation of grays (`gray1`, `gray2`, etc is much easier to type and remember than Tachyons' `moon-gray` etc)

This will be the API

```
<View classNames="flex-column justify-between bg-red">
  <Text classNames="gray1">Some text</Text>
</View>
```
